# Bulls and Cows

A browser game where you play against another player locally. You enter a secret number with 4 digits and the another player should guess the number you chose. each guess comes with an answer that says how good was the guess. if for example the secret number is 4271 and the player guessed 1234, then the answer will be: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".). The first player to guess another's secret will be the winner.
